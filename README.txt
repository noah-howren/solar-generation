This was work done for my class CS458: Introduction To Data Mining (at the University of Nevada, Reno) the focus of which was using python to analyze large datasets in various contexts to get some result that could be applied to predicting future outcomes based on forecasted/existing data. This project project we were allowed to use what methods we thought suited the situation best. I explain this process in my paper for this project (included PDF). I also provided the training and test dataset CSV file and of course code in the Python Notebook.
